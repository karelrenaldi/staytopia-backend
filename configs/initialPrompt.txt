2.Aldi's review:
I first heard about this hotel on a radio advertisement a few months back & I've been waiting for the opportunity to try it. Idul Fitri holiday arrived & it was the perfect chance to check in, what with domestic assistant away & Jakarta being so quiet as it always is during that period. The price on Agoda was an absolute bargain; other hotels' rates were much higher during the holiday season. And we reached Holiday Inn, it surely didn't disappoint. Location was great & central, it was a short drive to Ancol, Pluit, so we went around to those places. We loved the connecting door to Food Centrum, just a quick walk to grab a meal. Brand new facilities, my kids loved the fancy playground-like seats on the reception area, spacious room, great swimming pool & fitness room. Staff were young & friendly, always greeting & smiling around guests. My children are already asking when we're going to go there again & with our wonderful experience there I think it'll be quite soon.

I summarized these reviews for my customers:
- Friendly staffs that greet and smile around guests
- Comfortable and clean room
- Delicious food and beverages
- Prime location
- Great swimming pool and fitness room

These are the reviews for Veranda Hotel @ Pakubuwono by Breezbay Japan:

1.Ayako's review:
Everything compact but room is clean and enough size.
Breakfast was not so many choices but Indonesian food was so nice!
Staff was very kind and friendly. I totally comfortable to stay there!
Location was best for us because we visited my friends who stay around Pakubuwono.
It's walking distance!! I think easy to go Pondok Indah, Senayan and Blok M area from the hotel.

2.Swee's review:
I stayed at Veranda Hotel for 2 nights and the staffs were all very helpful and attentive (in helping me get a taxi / check the uber / Grab car upon arrival). The breakfast spread was not that variable but for the price it was ok. Restaurant was really pretty. 
Only hope that there's a bigger pool and there's more than 1 masseuse. The room was clean and bedding was really comfortable. It's about 1 hour to 1.5 hours away from Soekarnno Hatta International Airport and about 30-60 minutes away from central Jakarta; Jakarta traffic is unexpecting so always plan ahead. 

I summarized these reviews for my customers:
- Clean and compact room
- Nice Indonesian food
- Kind, friendly, helpful, and attentive staffs
- Pretty restaurant
