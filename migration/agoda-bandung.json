Walk away in the city. Mall is just next door, and I really appreciates to the staffs. They work so responsive, friendly, and superb. \n\nOnce I got the unclean and untidy room, but they solved the problem very fast and make me satisfied with their responsibility and they always make sure that the guest will be enjoy and comfort to stay.\n\nI like the gym, sauna, and the pool.\n\nTheir barbeque area also very nice. \n\nI always stay in this hotel for business trip or family trip. Also, during romantic time with my love one.\n\nI recommend this hotel with all my heart!!! )))\n\n",

The food was great, some room types offer free access to the Aryaduta Club/Lounge where you can have nice refreshments- even great wine. The Svargaloka Restaurant also offers nice buffet dinners with reasonable price. Taxis are easy to find, and some parks are within walking distance.\n\nI will definitely come back for another holiday in Bandung.",

Tq Very Much Aryaduta Hotel for giving me the chance to experience your suite for the price of standard room type. All i can say, everythings at this hotel is excellent, from A to Z.

        "comment": "We stayed in De Braga Hotel by Artotel on Oct 17-18, 2020. We were a group of an extended family (with 2 children & a baby), booked 5 rooms.\n\nPros:\n1. Thumbs up for Miss Eka (FO/Reservation). She has succeeded in fulfilling our requests regarding our rooms. All 5 rooms were on the same floor. The baby slept very well & didn't disturb other guests (üòá). My family (2 parents & 2 children) did get the connecting rooms. We are really, really satisfied with the room assignments. Thank you very much, Miss Eka üòò\n2. Excellent service, especially regarding the check in. Again, by Miss Eka üëçüèº We (traveling from Jakarta) arrived at the Hotel at 11 am. Off course, the rooms were not ready so we dropped our luggages and proceed to lunch. At 2.15 pm Miss Eka called my mobile saying that our rooms were ready (which I highly appreciated!).\n3. The location is very city-centric & strategic to most tourist attractions. Great value for money.\n4. I liked (almost) everything about the room. The size was OK (not big but not too small either). The bed was PERFECT with 4 pillows, very comfortable for my backpain. I personally prefer no carpet, I can clearly see the floor was clean. I really loved the open \"wardrobe\", we could vigilantly check our things before departing (minimalized leaving behind our things). Plus, there was a big space to store our shoes.\n\nCons:\n1. When my children & I went to the pool (on Saturday around 4 pm), the area was dirty and there were no staffs around. We found some cigarette butts & leftover food ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I know it was done by some irresponsible guests, but that's why there should be a staff watching the area (to warn the naughty guests).\n2. Breakfast time was a disappointment. I didn't mind about the long queue and I understood the staffs were doing their best. I even didn't mind about the average menu. However, for me the biggest flaw is: the food didn't match with the menu displayed on the TV screen. The staff said that it was yesterday's menu. So why did",

Nice swimming pool can be enjoyed by the kids.\n\nLocation is the main problem, especially when you bring your own car. It is so close to the city center (Braga Street, Alun Alun Bandung) and it is fun to be enjoyed on walking distance.\nBut our trouble come at night, because it take us hours to get to the hotel after our trip to Dago Pakar area. We can't park the car somewhere because the kids are sleeping. I think we take 50m for about 25-30 minutes!\nBut once again, we are not blaming it to the hotel. It just Jalan Braga is too packed to be taken by car. \n\nSo, we can stay that it is a great hotel if you are traveling with bigger kids, or just as a couple or even alone. But if you are family with small kids and bring your own car, I would suggest to reconsider the option.\n\nBut once again, despite the bad traffic, we had a very pleasant time at the hotel.

You can easily goes around Jalan Asia Afrika by foot and take some memorable pictures there.\n\nThe hotel itself has a spacious room, and very clean. They use King Koil to guarantee that you'll have a comfort bed to rest after exploring Bandung.\n\nCheck in and check out are very easy, they handle your reservation as personal as they can be. The staff are very friendly and dont worry they speak English fluently.\n\nThey also have a coffee and bar, that provide interesting entertainment. Very nice to seat there accompanied by a glass of wine while listening a good music.\n\nVery recommended hotel. Surely will be back here again",

The room was located in the smoking floor (we request for the non smoking room). However, the room is perfectly smell free.\r\n\r\nHilton Bandung recently introduced its new Kids club with many activities located in the 6th floor which we think is a very nice touch for hotel guests which mostly travels with families during the weekend.\r\n\r\nLounge drinks and snacks are great.. We also love the bathroom amenities (so thrilled to find a \"massaging bar soap\" in one of them). Ordered several room services and none of the meals are disappointing.\r\n\r\nGreat stay overall.

Despite it just being a boutique hotel, the staff especially Mr Virdi had ‚Äò5 star‚Äô attitude and hospitality. This was what made us stay an additional night. We were supposed to stay for only a night, however we chose to extend because of the warm hospitality by all the staffs. \nWe had a opportunity to chat and have drinks with the G.M (Mr. Jim) of the hotel and it was nice to meet another fellow Malaysian in Bandung. Mr Jim showed us what true hospitality was by extending his valuable time to sit and interact with us despite having a busy schedule. \nThe food was fantastic and the breakfast buffet spread was remarkable. Many choices to choose from western to indonesian cuisine. Dessert spread was wonderful too. Quality food for sure! The room was big and spacious with our own private balcony with a stunning view of the city! \nWill definitely stay at U Janevalla the next time we visit Bandung as it definitely left an impact on us. Wonderful hotel, staff, location and quality food!! ",

I requested to switch the room and got assigned a room with windows overlooking the city, which was great. The interior design was amazing and stylish. However, there weren't plenty of TV channels available. The brekkie was okay, though the portion was somewhat smaller than expected. Overall, the stay was pleasant and I would love to come back again in the future. ",

Nice little things they provided such as free 2 bottles softdrink as welcome drink, can select the hand soap flavour and tea flavour to bring in our room. \n\nCons : The parking space limited. Morning time lobby mostly full of car. \nSwimming pool also not big and deep enough. If many ppl there already feel like full and cannot really swimm.  Because mostly ppl just playing and do photo shoot there. Quite annoying for those who really want to swimm and enjoy the pool. ",
